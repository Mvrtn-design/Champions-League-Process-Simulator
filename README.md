# Champions-League-Process-Simulator
There are 32 teams involved in it, don't worry, it is a file to get the information from.

As I said, 32 teams, divided into 4 pots according to different conditions (national league position, country football level etc)
Those teams are grouped pot by pot into 8 groups, each of them of 4 teams where there also some conditions:
  - Obviusly one teams of a pot for group but also won't be possible have two teams from the same country.
  Every and each team has a category to give an extra point of realism to the final match result according to the real life team level.
  
By means of round-robin confrontations within each group, only the two best teams will qualify and will go on to another draw where each first team will face a second one from another group in a round with the 16 best teams.

This will be way until the only remaining one left as the best of all.
